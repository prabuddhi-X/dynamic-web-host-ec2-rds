## What I learnt 
- Installing PHP on a server often brings in Apache2 as a dependency, especially when using package managers like apt, which helps serve PHP pages.
- Even without fully understanding PHP code, I learned that it connects to a MySQL database using embedded values like database name, username, and password.
- To host a PHP-based web application, I need to configure a virtual host in the sites-available directory
# Notes
- AWS resources are deleted after testing the project to avoid costs
- **The php and MySQL codes that I used in this project was generated by using OpenAI's ChatGPT**
